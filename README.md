# python-api-challenge

Hey there, welcome to my Python API Challenge Repository for Module 6. Here you will find my GitIgnore file that contains the relative path to the API keys I used 
in this assignment. Additionally, there is a WeatherPy folder that contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the VacationPy and WeatherPy code deliverables. Finally, there
is an Output Data folder that contains the scatter plots for WeatherPy latitude comparisons, as well as their respective linear regression models. Thank you.
